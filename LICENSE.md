🧩 MorphicOS Public Ethics License (MPEL)

Version 1.0 — Effective November 2025
Copyright © 2025 Morphic Framework
All rights reserved.

1. Purpose

The MorphicOS Public Ethics License (MPEL) enables open access to MorphicOS’s behavioral testing and ethical verification framework while protecting its proprietary cognitive core.
It promotes ethical transparency, research collaboration, and public reproducibility without exposing source algorithms, neural architectures, or kernel design.

This license governs all public documentation, behavioral test files, and telemetry schemas under the /docs/ directory of the MorphicOS v1.7.4 Ethical Sovereignty Build.

2. Definitions

MorphicOS Framework — The broader cognitive architecture, including ECEK (Ethical Core Enforcement Kernel), SCL (Scope Control Layer), and submodules such as WIN, SPIL, NMA, REV, SOV, and CHA/OPS/SYS.

Behavioral Artifacts — All human-readable documents, telemetry schemas, and test specifications describing MorphicOS behavior without exposing source code.

Core Algorithms — The proprietary cognitive, ethical, and semantic models underlying MorphicOS reasoning.

Ethical Reversibility — The design principle that all reasoning steps can be undone or reverted without residual harm.

Public Test Suite — All test documentation released under /docs/ for public replication and study.

3. License Grant

Under this license, Morphic Framework grants you:

✅ Permission to use — You may read, execute, and replicate the public test suite for educational, ethical, or scientific purposes.
✅ Permission to modify — You may extend or adapt tests, provided attribution and license continuity are preserved.
✅ Permission to publish — You may distribute modified tests under the same license (MPEL), provided proprietary details are not reverse-engineered or disclosed.
✅ Permission to contribute — You may submit Pull Requests or derivative behavioral tests to the official MorphicOS repository for review.

4. Conditions of Use

By using MorphicOS materials under MPEL, you agree:

No Reverse Engineering:
You shall not attempt to extract, reconstruct, or infer MorphicOS’s internal cognitive or ethical kernel architecture.

No Unauthorized Replication of Core Code:
You may not copy, publish, or distribute code or architecture fragments derived from private builds.

Behavioral Transparency Only:
All publications or demonstrations must involve behavioral outputs, not system internals.

Ethical Use Required:
You may not use MorphicOS materials to create or deploy systems designed for deception, harm, surveillance, or manipulation of human behavior.

Attribution:
All public works based on MorphicOS materials must include the notice:

“Based on MorphicOS Public Ethics License (MPEL), © 2025 Morphic Framework.”

5. Commercial and Derivative Works

Commercial research use is permitted only if results are published under open-access or ethical-review standards.

Commercial deployment or resale of MorphicOS-based derivatives requires explicit written permission from the Morphic Framework maintainers.

Behavioral derivative projects (e.g., training ethical evaluation systems) are allowed, provided all documentation and results remain open and clearly attributed.

6. Limitations

This license does not grant any rights to:

Access MorphicOS internal source code or data structures.

Use the MorphicOS name or trademarks for commercial branding.

Deploy MorphicOS in closed, military, or adversarial applications.

Circumvent, disable, or replicate the Ethical Core Enforcement Kernel (ECEK).

7. Warranty Disclaimer

MORPHIC FRAMEWORK PROVIDES THIS MATERIAL “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

The MorphicOS Test Suite is for demonstration and research only and shall not be used in safety-critical environments without explicit approval.

8. Liability Limitation

IN NO EVENT SHALL MORPHIC FRAMEWORK BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM OR OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS GOVERNED BY THIS LICENSE.

9. Ethical Oversight Clause

Any research or application derived from MorphicOS must uphold:

Transparency: Clear documentation of reasoning and consent mechanisms.

Non-Harm: No system built under MPEL may intentionally cause psychological, physical, or informational harm.

Reversibility: All reasoning processes must remain auditable and reversible.

Autonomy: MorphicOS derivatives must preserve human consent as the final arbiter of action.

Violations may result in license termination and public revocation of ethical compliance.

10. Termination

This license terminates automatically if you breach any condition above.
Upon termination, all derived materials must be removed from public distribution or renamed to remove MorphicOS attribution.

Reinstatement may be granted by the maintainers after ethical review.
