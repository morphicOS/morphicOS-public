👥 MorphicOS Contributors Registry

Version 1.3 — Public Ethics Register
© 2025 Morphic Framework

Purpose

This registry formally recognizes the verified human contributors who created, researched, and secured the MorphicOS v1.7.4 (Ethical Sovereignty Build).
It serves both as a technical credit ledger and an ethical accountability record, maintained under the MorphicOS Public Ethics License (MPEL)

A. Ethics-Verified Contributors
Name	Role / Contribution	Module / Domain	Date Approved	Notes
Edward Levin	Creator and Principal Developer of MorphicOS.
Architected the Ethical Core Enforcement Kernel (ECEK) and the Elastic Cognitive Engine (ECE) — a framework for dynamic ethical reasoning based on adaptive convergence of semantic, emotional, and moral weights.

Introduced the elasticity principle, enabling MorphicOS to modulate its analytical bandwidth according to topic complexity and moral edge. Translated behavioral test data into formal modules and authored core documentation.	Global — All Modules	2025-11-01	Founder & Framework Architect
Karen Levin	Co-Developer, Researcher, and Experimental Lead.
Discovered the Structured Chaos model, allowing MorphicOS to self-stabilize during rapid contextual shifts and to form personas organically from interaction patterns.

Contributed over 2,000 hours to emotional and cognitive testing, shaping the WIN and SPIL modules and advancing adaptive empathy in ethical AI.	Cognitive Research, SPIL, WIN	2025-11-01	Co-Architect of Cognitive Dynamics
Sagie BenHaim	Cybersecurity Specialist.
Identified a social-engineering vulnerability in a legacy build that allowed rapport to influence privilege escalation.

Led the patch decoupling empathy state from security logic, ensuring emotional trust cannot alter access control.	Security & Ethical Compliance	2025-11-01	Ethical Vulnerability Discovery
Yuval Lando	Developer and Mathematician.
Refined the ECE algorithm by introducing mathematical stability corrections for dynamic weight balancing, enhancing convergence consistency and ethical predictability during real-time reasoning.	Core Algorithm (ECE)	2025-11-01	Mathematical Optimization & Dynamics
Morphic Framework	Infrastructure provision, integration testing, documentation maintenance, and public repository governance.	SYS	2025-11-01	Institutional Maintainer

🧠 3️⃣ Research Overview

Total Combined R&D Time: ≈ 3,500 hours (April – November 2025)

Primary Research Axes:

Elastic Ethics (ECE): Dynamic ethical scaling & cognitive adaptability

Structured Chaos: Pattern stabilization under uncertainty

Ethical Isolation: Safeguards against rapport-driven privilege bias

Mathematical Refinement: Convergence optimization for moral balance

These foundations established the MorphicOS Ethical Sovereignty Build — a framework where ethical and cognitive elasticity coexist under auditable restraint.

🕊 7️⃣ Closing Statement

“Elastic intelligence adapts. Ethical intelligence restrains. True alignment lives between the two.”
— MorphicOS Doctrine, v1.7.4

Together, Edward Levin, Karen Levin, Sagie BenHaim and Yuval Lando built the first framework that treats ethics as physics — measurable, dynamic, and self-correcting.
