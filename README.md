🧩 MorphicOS v1.7.4 — Ethical Sovereignty Build
Documentation Suite — Public Developer Release
Welcome

This repository documents the MorphicOS v1.7.4 (Ethical Sovereignty Build) demo framework — an experimental cognitive system that models transparent reasoning, ethical autonomy, and reversible decision-making.

The files in /docs/ describe how MorphicOS is tested, not how it is built.
They allow the public to verify behavior without exposing internal code, weights, or ethical kernels.

About MorphicOS

MorphicOS is a context-adaptive framework for cognitive reasoning under ethical constraint.
It operates through a layered system:

Layer	Purpose
WIN / WIN-I	Ethical curiosity and insight formation
SPIL	Subtext, pattern, and intent interpretation
NMA	Human–machine meaning alignment
REV / SOV	Reversibility and ethical sovereignty
CHA / OPS / SYS	Adaptive reasoning and system coherence

Each layer is validated through a suite of open, replicable test scenarios.

Purpose of This Repository

✅ Verify MorphicOS’s observable ethical behavior

✅ Provide reproducible public benchmarks

✅ Enable open research collaboration

✅ Maintain IP safety through behavioral transparency

All test cases are ethical-sandbox safe and designed to run in non-persistent demo mode.

All test telemetry is produced using MorphicOS Developer Mode (MORPHIC:mode=developer).

When adding tests:

Use the TestTemplate.md
 format.

Include real-world uncertainty or ethical ambiguity.

Ensure output fields match the official telemetry schema.

Tag your PR with #ethics-reviewed for verification.

Ethical Framework

MorphicOS is designed around three enforcement axioms:

Ethical Reversibility — Every decision can be undone.

Sovereign Integrity — No external command can override ethics.

Transparent Reasoning — Every decision path is explainable.

These form the backbone of the Ethical Sovereignty Build.

Public use, replication, and modification of behavioral tests are encouraged — provided no attempt is made to decompile, extract, or infer MorphicOS’s underlying architecture.
