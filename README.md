## 🧠 Overview

**MorphicOS** is the cognitive kernel of the **maugos runtime** — a modular, ethical reasoning framework designed to demonstrate that intelligence can operate with **consent, reversibility, and transparency**.

The **v1.7.4-beta** demo build presents the active reasoning and ethical safeguards that form Morphic’s foundation.  
It is intended for public exploration and educational purposes, not for commercial or production use.

| **Testing Framework** | Modular behavioral test suites validating ethical and cognitive stability (`/tests`). |
| **Documentation Suite** | Reference materials, telemetry schema, glossary, and contributor acknowledgments (`/docs`). |
